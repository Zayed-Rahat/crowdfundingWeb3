## Getting Started

Create a project using this example:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --contract --template hardhat-javascript-starter
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `contracts/Contract.sol`.

To add functionality to your contracts, you can use the `@thirdweb-dev/contracts` package which provides base contracts and extensions to inherit. The package is already installed with this project. Head to our [Contracts Extensions Docs](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contractkit) to learn more.
